# Hacking Terminal Simulator

A lightweight front-end **hacking terminal simulator** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It visually simulates terminal activity using blinking dots, animated messages, and a neon-green aesthetic — purely for fun and educational display.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This project displays fake terminal messages with a retro hacking vibe.  
Each message appears one by one with random delays to create a realistic “loading” effect.  
It’s a front-end only simulation — no backend, no real hacking.
