## Overview
This project simulates a retro-style terminal using a neon-green aesthetic and subtle animations. Messages are displayed sequentially with blinking indicators and randomized delays to create a realistic “terminal processing” feel. The goal is to showcase UI/UX polish and animation technique without performing any network activity or data access.
